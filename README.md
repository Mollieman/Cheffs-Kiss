# Cheffs-Kiss
chef's kiss connects to GraphDB on http://localhost:7200 and queries the Allergies repository. Please run the following steps to configure GraphDB correctly:

1) Create a new repository with Allergies as its repository ID and OWL-Max (Optimized) as its Ruleset.
2) Import the ontology_project.ttl dataset by copying the code and pasting it into the text snippet option.
